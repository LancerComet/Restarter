# Update your PHP version

[PHP](http://www.php.net) is the most popular **server-side** scripting language, powering millions of websites including most WooCommerce shops.

!> Running your shop on an **outdated and unmaintained** version of PHP will definitely affect your website’s performance (a lot) lower than it should be, you may find that things do not work as you expect and be open to **security vulnerabilities**!

## What is PHP?

PHP is a scripting language which most likely powers your WordPress and WooCommerce shop. PHP, like all software, gets updated over time to patch security issues and improve its features. And like other software, it’s important to keep your PHP version **up to date**.

## Contact your host

Contacting your hosting company is usually the easiest way to find out how you can update your PHP version. They probably already have newer PHP versions available, they just need to update your account.

!> The upgrade process is an easy process and should be something your host can do for you **without impacting your website or charging you a fee**. Here’s a letter you can send to your service provider company:

<blockquote>
Dear service provider,<br/><br/>

I’m running a WordPress website on one of your servers and Restarter Plus plugin has recommended using at least PHP 7.0 or above. Also, WordPress, the content management system that Restarter Plus plugin uses, has listed PHP 7 as the recommended version on their requirements page:<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

Looking forward to your reply.

You will have to ask them to be updated to a currently supported PHP version. At this moment, it’s safe to run on **PHP 7.0**, but it doesn’t hurt to get upgraded​ to **PHP 7.1** or higher already.
